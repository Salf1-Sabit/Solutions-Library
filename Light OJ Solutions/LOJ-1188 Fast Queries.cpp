 * Problem summary: Find the number of distinct elems in a range in between queries

/* Why this algo: This algo is used to answer those queries which are 
 * dynamic e.g. (distinct elems). Which cannot be done using segment tree. */ 

/* Time Complexity: O((N + Q) F sqrt(N)). Where F = time of add-remove functions. 
 *     -> Firstly, if all of the left index are at same block then, for one block 
 *   we will move our right index at most N times. Then, for every block we will 
 *   have O(N * sqrt(N)) times. 
 * 	   -> Secondly, for each query our left pointer can move at most sqrt(N) times. 
 * 	 Because, each block has at most sqrt(N) cells. So, for Q query there will 
 * 	 be O(Q * sqrt(N)) calls at most. 
 *	   -> Hence, O(N * sqrt(N) + Q * sqrt(N)) = O((N + Q) * sqrt(N)) by taking 
 *	   sqrt(N) common from both sides. */
